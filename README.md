# Image_Resizer
"Image Resizer" is a Python project leveraging the OpenCV library (cv2) to resize images efficiently. 
This project offers a simple yet powerful solution for adjusting the dimensions of images while maintaining aspect ratios. 
Users can specify the scale percentage or exact dimensions for resizing, and the program seamlessly processes the images, saving the resized versions. 
With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, Image Resizer streamlines the process of preparing images for various applications, from web development to multimedia presentations.
